Early today, I wanted to add a shortcut in my dock on OSX.

It turns out that it's really easy to do. When you're in Safari, just drag the little icon to the dock, et voila!

### But, it looks ugly...

No problem! If you want a custom icon, its a little tedious, but easily done and well worth the trouble if you have more than one page you want to shortcut.

Here's how to use a custom icon for your OSX web page dock shortcut:

1. Go to the website you wish to shortcut. Drag the little icon in the address bar TO YOUR DESKTOP.
1. Go to [https://images.google.com](https://images.google.com) and find the icon you want to use. If you add "png" to the end of the search, you'll find one with a transparent background. In my case, I was looking for an Arsenal logo, so I searched for "arsenal logo png". Download the image to your desktop (eg. drag it to your desktop).
1. Go to [iConvert Icons](http://iconverticons.com/online/). Upload the image you just downloaded. Then, click the arrow beside "ICNS" and click "icns file". This should download to your Downloads folder.
1. Right click on the file you just created on your desktop and select "Get Info".
1. Open your downloads folder and drag the new icon into the icon at the top of the "Get Info" page.

And there you have it... enjoy!
