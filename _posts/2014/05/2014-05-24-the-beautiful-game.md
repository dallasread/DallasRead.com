### Flashes of brilliance

This tribute video of 2014's incredibly talented Spurs squad showcases the beauty of team sport. Watching these guys move the ball around is an honour. They're quick, fluid, and bold in movement. Their timing is right. They flow:

### The game like its meant to be played?

Unfortunately, there is no "deserve" in sports. "Fundamental" doesn't matter. There is no "proper" strategy. There is no basketball karma for smooth movement and "unselfish" passes; there is only win.

The W doesn't go to the team with the most possession, shots, powerplays, passes, assists, blocks, or FG%. Only one number on the stats sheet matters: the score.

### MVP vs. Team-play

If you want to win, who do you rely on?

An MVP? Or team-play?

> Without a doubt, even the best player can do little to defend a team that's on its game, moving the ball around. *The team that plays with the most teamwork should win.*

What a wishfully romantic notion, valuing all players equally and noone stands out!

A team can only play as good as its most tired and unfocused player. You need all 5 guys on the court to be on their A-Game, all game, on-rhythm, and in-sync. It happens, but its rare.

MVPs are MVPs because they bring their best every single night. They're consistent. They're stable. They're solid. They know how to win. It's what they do.

I'll take 1 great player over 5 good players any day.
