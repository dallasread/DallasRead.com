Attention is the greatest asset of our time... because there's a finite amount of it. Billions of decisions make up your audience's day (or the audience of a future you). They are constantly prioritizing what they want to watch, buy, and read.


Can they exist without you? **Yes.**


Would their life be better with you? **Absolutely** (if you don't believe it, shift your perspective)!


We're in the era of showmanship and choices. When wooing an audience, you must entertain. How do you keep them on the edge of their seats? Tell them what they want to hear:


- Encourage their dreams
- Justify their failures
- Allay their fears
- Confirm their suspicions
- Help them throw rock at their enemies
