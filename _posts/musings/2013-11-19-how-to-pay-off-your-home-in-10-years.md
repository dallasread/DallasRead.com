Yesterday, while I was banking online, PC Financial offered [this home-buying advice](http://www.banking.pcfinancial.ca/mkt/common/promos/mortgage2013spring-en.html) based on a $200,000 home:

1. By switching from monthly payments to accelerated bi-weekly payments, you can cut 3 years off your mortgage.
2. By paying an extra $100 bi-weekly, you can cut 5 more years off your mortgage.
3. By paying an extra $1,000 payment each year, you can cut 1 year off your mortgage.

"Thatâ€™s mortgage freedom in just 16 years instead of 25!", they promise. In case you're wondering, it works out to paying an extra $4,640 per year ($13 per day).

Is it worth it?

### A $1,000 lump sum payment - no thanks.
It's a psychological drain - setting aside money all year to make one double-payment. I'd rather have an extra $50 tacked on to my regular payment. Besides, it only takes 1 year off your mortgage...

### Regularly pay an extra 20% - meh.
Paying an extra $2,600 per year could be a serious difference in lifestyle if you're living close to the edge. To knock 5 years in this fashion is probably going to mean sacrifice.

### Accelerated payments - absolutely.
You won't even feel a thing and it'll give you $1,000 in extra equity per year. You don't have to sacrifice much - maybe a few nights out, a small vacation, or a daily Starbucks. This is an easy way to knock 3 years off any mortgage.

### What would happen if, instead, you just doubled your payment?
The same mortgage would be paid off in less than 10 years. Why don't you just do that?
