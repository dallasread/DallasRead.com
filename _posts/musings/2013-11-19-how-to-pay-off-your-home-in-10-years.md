Yesterday, while I was banking online, PC Financial offered [this home-buying advice](http://www.banking.pcfinancial.ca/mkt/common/promos/mortgage2013spring-en.html) based on a $200,000 home:

1. By switching from monthly payments to accelerated bi-weekly payments, you can cut 3 years off your mortgage.
2. By paying an extra $100 bi-weekly, you can cut 5 more years off your mortgage.
3. By paying an extra $1,000 payment each year, you can cut 1 year off your mortgage.

"Thatâ€™s mortgage freedom in just 16 years instead of 25!", they promise. In case you're wondering, it works out to paying an extra $4,640 per year ($13 per day).

Is it worth it?

### What would happen if, instead, you just doubled your payment?
The same mortgage would be paid off in less than 10 years. Why don't you just do that?
