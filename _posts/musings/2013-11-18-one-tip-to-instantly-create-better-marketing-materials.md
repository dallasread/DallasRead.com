I've seen _every_ marketing medium fail: million-dollar TV commercials, newspaper ads, websites, and billboards. Each failure has 1 thing in common:

They don't offer a clear "Next Thing To Do."

### Clever vs. Clear

Many campaigns have failed by trying to be too clever, witty, or poetic. 

When people don't know what to do next, they leave. When you're not clear what action they _should_ take, they leave. This is [the paradox of choice](http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html).

### Why do we believe the lie?

For some reason, we've bought in to the fact that "clever" or "cute" is the only way to win over a crowd. We've found ourselves believing that refined gradients and bevelled edges are a requirement before someone hands us their credit card.

### How to Instantly Improve Your Marketing

Each marketing piece should have a prominent "Next Thing To Do" for the reader. They're reading what you have to say... they already want to believe that you have something to offer. By offering them more, they can continue to be a part of the story.

Here are a few "Next Thing To Do" ideas:
- On a blog, provide a links of other suggested articles.
- On a mailing, offer the reader something free for responding and telling their story.
- At the end of a TV ad, get the viewer to text a number for a free sample.
- At the end of a blog article, offer a comments/contact section to collect viewer responses.
