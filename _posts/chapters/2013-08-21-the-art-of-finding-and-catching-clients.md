In the strictest sense of the word, a “business” can’t exist without customers. Eventually the money will dry up and the lights’ll be turned off.  It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that successful companies have learned to harness the power of their existing customer base and perfected the art of finding new customers.

Customers can come from anywhere, disguised as anything - especially in our golden, technological age of the internet. Your customer can literally live 1000 miles away, be 50 years older/younger than you, and not even speak your language.

To increase your profits, you can:
<ul>
  <li>increase the <strong>quality</strong> of your customers.</li>
  <li>increase the <strong>quantity</strong> of your customers.</li>
</ul>

There are many ways to do either, but let’s draw an analogy from an international, archaic-yet-also-modern pastime: fishing.
Our good friends at Wikipedia tell us that there are five basic ways to catch a fish. Why do some use nets and others use poles? <strong>The only reason to choose one fishing method over another depends on what your goals are, but a healthy company uses a curated balance of all methods because each have their own strengths.</strong> Let’s examine the 5 strategies and how to apply their strengths to your business:

### Hand Gathering :: Customer Interaction

Getting down in the water, picking up crabs from ocean floor may not be the cleanest nor most appealing job, but it works. It’s not efficient, but its easy to get started because it requires no equipment. It’s the only fishing method that doesn’t require bait. It’s also the method where the fisherman is closest to the fish.

Hand gathering your customers is a great place to start building a business. Fishing by hand only requires time and patience - and anyone can make a cold call, send a cold email, or sell door-to-door. Even if you’re the worst salesperson in history, you’ll eventually make a sale. 
When you’re on the front lines, you learn the most about your customers - what they need, what they want, and what they like. Most businesses start off at this phase, but migrate to where the bigger fish are.

### Angling :: Automation

Angling is traditional fishing - with a pole, bait, hook, line, and sinker. This method takes patience, but there is a chance of catching a bigger fish, but it requires a little investment in equipment. The good news is that you don’t have to get dirty or be in the water. You can be quite comfortable sitting on a dock or in a boat. You’ll also need to do your research, so that you know where the fish are biting.

Catching customers with a bait and hook will be a waiting game. You’ll need a good lure, something to draw in your prospects. It could be a gift, a free consultation, or a big promise.
To make sure you’re not just standing on the shore looking like an idiot2, you’ll want to have done your research. You’ll want to know where the fish, your customers, are. 

There are a few places to look to find customers:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Where do your successful competitors find their customers?</strong> Do they do online advertising? Do they advertise in a directory? Do they post flyers up around town? There’s a good chance you’ll be successful if they are.</li>

  <li><strong>Find complaints online (try Amazon.com and Ebay.com).</strong> These guys sell/have everything. What are the top selling items in your industry? Read the comments, especially complaints. These people are in an ideal position to be lured. They have a need and are dissatisfied with their current service. Send them an email. If you can’t find your service on here, you may be heading into an uphill, upwind battle.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Create an audience.</strong> The gist of finding followers is building or offering something that people care about. With the right angle, you can make them care about anything.</li>

  <li><strong>Ask your current customers.</strong> Often times, simply asking your current customers will be successful. There’s no need to be pushy. If they’re truly “wowed” by your service and know of others interested, they’ll be quick to pass your name along.</li>

</ul>

### Spearfishing :: Targeted Follow-up

Hand gathering, angling, and spearfishing are all quality related. Each advancing technique targets bigger and better fish.

When spearfishing, you can catch the biggest of sea animals; you’re not going to waste your time on a little tuna. Whales, sharks, and whale-sharks are all within your capabilities and technologies. When you’re spearfishing, you rely heavily on your tools and your ability to use them. They need to be tweaked and fine-tuned to perfection, completely catered to what you’re catching.

When spearfishing, it takes accuracy, investment, and precision. Though each fish is individual and behaves differently, they follow similar patterns. The first spear you throw probably won’t hit its target, but you’ll become more accurate as you invest in tools and time. Eventually, you’ll be able to catch “big ones” with one short burst of concentrated strength and focus.

Spearfishing customers takes the shape of targeting customers through a series of letters, gifts, emails, and teaching. Every business is different, but there’s always a magic combination of events that will lure the customer in and seal the deal.

### Netting :: Quick Wins

Casting a net out, with bait, is an efficient way to catch a lot of fish. Netting also catches you lots of everything else. You’re going to end up dragging around extra pounds of seaweed, wasting time and energy (which is okay if you are prepared). Casting a wide net has a focus on quantity, not quality.

Using a net to find new customers is a helpful way to see massive results quickly, but it comes at a cost. Advertising on the internet, billboards, television, newspapers, magazines, and classifieds can have a massive impact on your business, but it takes an immense amount of resources. A proper “netting” campaign is performed over a long period of time and is driven by the data of previous campaigns.

### Trapping :: Automation

Trapping is the secret to big, consistent catches of fish. If you’re a trap fisherman, you’re time is spent going from trap to trap, merely collecting all the fish that are there for you already. You won’t ever have to spend time waiting for fish again!

A trap takes a little longer to set up than the other methods. You have to do your research to find where the fish are, and you must have a trap that is capable of holding and catching your target. In most cases, you would only place a trap after you’ve angled or gathered by hand in the same area.

Putting a system in place to continually catch lots of lucrative customers is the best investment you can make. You’ll truly be able to focus on your business, and not have to worry about where your next customer is coming from.
