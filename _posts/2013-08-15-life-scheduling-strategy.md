I could make a thousand comparisons about the self-employed lifestyle versus the employee, work-for-the-man lifestyle - and perhaps I will one day. For now, I'm struck by the differences between their day-to-day, time-management strategies.

### Do you have a schedule like this (at work *or* home)?

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Monday</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; ">12:00</td>
      <td>Wash the car</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; ">1:30</td>
      <td>Paint the house</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; ">2:00</td>
      <td>Clean the kitchen</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; ">3:30</td>
      <td>Take a walk</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### If so, you're doing it wrong.

I've tried it before. It works for a while, but you quickly fall behind. Next time, try something like this: 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Monday</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right">
        <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" />
      </td>
      <td>Wash the car</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right">
        <input type="checkbox" />
      </td>
      <td>Paint the house</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right">
        <input type="checkbox" />
      </td>
      <td>Clean the kitchen</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right">
        <input type="checkbox" />
      </td>
      <td>Take a walk</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Your intentions are clearest when you use a checklist.

Look at the first, time-dependent list above. What's the most important thing? 

It's impossible to tell.

Now look at the checklist. What's the most important thing to do on this list?

The task at the top of the list!

### Don't be time-driven, be task-driven.
When you're time-driven, one activity turns into two activities. When you're task-driven, it allows you to clearly focus on the desired result. Sadly, our culture is obsessed with *time*, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO_Q_f1WgQI">it really doesn't exist</a>.

### MY priorities for me <span style="color: #999; font-weight: normal; ">vs.</span> YOUR priorities for me

The easiest way to *feel* effective is to react to things around you - your coworkers, your boss, your clients, news. It's also the surest way to get absolutely nothing useful done. It's easy to fall into this trap because it *feels* productive.

### Make your tasks bite-sized.

Smaller, simpler tasks are easier to charge through. There actually more forget-resistant. For instance:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right">
        <input type="checkbox" />
      </td>
      <td>Take a trip to Wales.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This, itself, is a huge task. There are flights and accomodations to be booked, passports to be confirmed, and money to raised. Breaking a bigger task into smaller pieces makes it seem more reachable and less likely to be forgotten:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right">
        <input type="checkbox" />
      </td>
      <td>Book flight.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right">
        <input type="checkbox" />
      </td>
      <td>Book accomodation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right">
        <input type="checkbox" />
      </td>
      <td>Comfirm passports.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right">
        <input type="checkbox" />
      </td>
      <td>Make spending money.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
