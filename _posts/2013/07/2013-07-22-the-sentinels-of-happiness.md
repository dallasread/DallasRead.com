####Only one sentinel shields you from happiness: No Progress. For definiteness of happiness, destroy it and thrive.

###Happiness is progress.
####You are happiest when you’re moving toward a goal.

Happiness is fulfillment. Forward motion forces satisfaction and a smile, breathes hope and prospect. Progress advances on what it wants; change without purpose drains.

###Progress requires destination.
####You can only close in on something that is defined.

Progress admits movement is required. Progress does not require a “Why?”, only a “Where?” Purpose is arbitrary. Destination is necessary.

###Progress does not require purpose.
####Purpose is irrelevant to happiness.

If a purpose can be met in one moment in time, it is not a purpose, but a destination. Your destination is derived from purpose.

###Happiness is moving toward a goal.
