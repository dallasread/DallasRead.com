Yesterday, as I was consulting for [Email Opened](http://www.emailopened.com), we were discussing a new [top-secret] feature. We knew it would be useful, but it would be a huge project. Where do you start?

###Ask questions.
To start, explore.

- Who will be using it?
- What are they trying to do?
- Where are they coming from?
- How do we make this easier for them?
- Is there an easier technical implementation?
- Can we cut this idea in half?

After a quick, 20-minute discussion, we decided that we could easily break the feature in smaller parts.

###Tell & show.
Discussing ideas is fun and stimulating, but it leads down a never-ending, meandering path. Talking in unreals (things that don't exist) when you're trying to do something is a waste of time. It's *always* better to talk about something concrete. Vague ideas make it easy to disagree.

So, I opened to Photoshop. How would someone use this feature? Where would you see it?

Almost instantly, instead of disagreeing about the ideals of the feature, we were choosing. Is it better here or there? Should it be this colour, or that? Dealing with tangibles puts you in action mode.
