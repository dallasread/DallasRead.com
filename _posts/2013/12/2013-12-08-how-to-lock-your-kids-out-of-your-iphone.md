> Here, Jimmy, go play with my iPhone for a bit.

### 5 minutes, 4 phone calls, and 3 text messages later...

Wouldn't it be even better if we could disable certain areas of the screen so that our boss didn't receive those scrambled text messages when our kids are playing on our phone?

### Introducing "Guided Access."

Believe it or not, this is built right in to your iPhone (iOS 7), without requiring any apps.

1. Go to the "Settings" app.
2. Click on "Accessibility."
3. Click on "Guided Access."
4. Turn both "Guided Access" and "Accessibility Shortcut" ON.

5. Go to your favourite app and triple click the home button (the main iPhone button).
6. Now, circle the parts of the screen that you want to lock and click "Start."
7. To cancel "Guided Access" mode, triple click the home button again and click "End."

Enjoy!
