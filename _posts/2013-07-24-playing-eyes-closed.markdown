## Eyes-Closed Is Easy (I could do that…)

Playing with your eyes closed doesn’t mean you’re playing blind. Sometimes you’re not in the zone, so you close your eyes. Sometimes you’re just not up to the task ahead of you, so you close your eyes. Sometimes you’re under pressure, so you close your eyes. Sometimes you’re scared out of your mind, so you close your eyes. That’s when instinct takes over.

At this point, you’re in your element. Outsiders see you working and view your work as easy and simple - until they try it. Easy is a word to describe someone else’s work.

What’s your element? What’s the last thing you did that came “naturally" to you? Don’t lie to yourself. It must be something that other people think you’re good at too.

In a few regular season games, Michael Jordan shot a few eyes-closed free throws. (He also missed more shots than he scored.)

## How do you learn to play eyes-closed?

Put in your time - Try things. Set goals. Focus. Read. Think. Act. Bottom line: you’ve got to want it. And then you’ve made it, keep putting in more time.

The most successful professionals (in athletics and business) are the ones that can do their basic, day-to-day activities with their eyes closed. Easily, naturally, and fluid. Even bad days can’t throw them off.

## It’s your time to shine

The reason why these professionals met their success goes a little deeper, though. They instinctively seek out course-changing decisions each day. They get the basics done with, then press on into the unknown.
